## Introduction

**UFO** is a **UI-Focused** multi-agent framework to fulfill user requests on **Windows OS** by seamlessly navigating and operating within individual or spanning multiple applications.

## 🕌 Framework
<b>UFO</b> <img src="./img/ufo_blue.png" alt="UFO Image" width="24"> operates as a multi-agent framework, encompassing:

- <b>HostAgent 🤖</b>, tasked with choosing an application for fulfilling user requests. This agent may also switch to a different application when a request spans multiple applications, and the task is partially completed in the preceding application. 

- <b>AppAgent 👾</b>, responsible for iteratively executing actions on the selected applications until the task is successfully concluded within a specific application. 

- <b>Application Automator 🎮</b>, is tasked with translating actions from HostAgent and AppAgent into interactions with the application and through UI controls, native APIs or AI tools. Check out more details [here](./automator/overview.md).

Both agents leverage the multi-modal capabilities of Visual Language Model (VLM) to comprehend the application UI and fulfill the user's request. For more details, please consult our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07939).

## 💥 Highlights

- [x] **First Windows Agent** - UFO is the pioneering agent framework capable of translating user requests in natural language into actionable operations on Windows OS.
- [x] **Agent as an Expert** - UFO is enhanced by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) from heterogeneous sources, including offline help documents, online search engines, and human demonstrations, making the agent an application "expert".
- [x] **Rich Skill Set** - UFO is equipped with a diverse set of skills to support comprehensive automation, such as mouse, keyboard, native API, and "Copilot".
- [x] **Interactive Mode** - UFO facilitates multiple sub-requests from users within the same session, enabling the seamless completion of complex tasks.
- [x] **Agent Customization** - UFO allows users to customize their own agents by providing additional information. The agent will proactively query users for details when necessary to better tailor its behavior.
- [x] **Scalable AppAgent Creation** - UFO offers extensibility, allowing users and app developers to create their own AppAgents in an easy and scalable way.
